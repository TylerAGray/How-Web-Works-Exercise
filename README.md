1. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: It's a set of rules for transferring data over the internet. It enables web browsers to request and receive web pages and other resources from web servers.

2. **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**: It's the address of a specific resource on the internet. URLs specify the protocol to be used (like HTTP or HTTPS), the domain name, and the path to the resource.

3. **DNS (Domain Name System)**: It's like a phone book for the internet, translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use to communicate. DNS servers match domain names to their corresponding IP addresses, enabling users to access websites using familiar names instead of numeric IP addresses.

4. **Query String**: It's a part of a URL containing data sent to a web server as parameters. It's typically used for passing information like search terms or user inputs to the server.

5. **HTTP Verbs**: They are actions used to perform different operations on resources. `GET` retrieves data from a server, while `POST` submits data to be processed or stored on the server.

6. **HTTP Request**: It's a message sent from a client to a server, asking for a specific action or resource. It includes information like the URL, HTTP method, and optional data.

7. **HTTP Response**: It's a message sent from a server to a client in reply to an HTTP request. It contains the requested resource along with additional metadata like response status and headers.

8. **HTTP Header**: It's additional information sent along with HTTP requests and responses. Headers provide details such as content type, caching instructions, and client/browser information.

9. **Process of Typing a URL into a Browser**: When you type a URL into a browser, the browser checks if it's valid, translates the domain name to an IP address using DNS, sends an HTTP request to the server specified in the URL, and receives an HTTP response containing the requested web page.
